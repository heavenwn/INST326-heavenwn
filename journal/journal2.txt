Week 2
This week I used AI while working on the exercises. There were a couple 
of concepts that I needed a refresher on so I used google AI to remind 
me of what the concept is and how to use it. I didn't use AI for debugging

I also used AI to generate broad ideas on what paths I could take on
for my group project.
