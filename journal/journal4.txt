Week 4
This week I used AI to help me on question 19 of the week 4 exercises 
because I was not too familiar with dictionaries and how to find the
largest numbers within the integers in the dictionary. I also used
AI to give me some ideas on what type of functions I could try 
incorporting into my group project.
